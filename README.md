# JobIt

![](mainscreen.avif) ![](jobdetailsscreen.avif) ![](searchscreen.avif)

JobIt is a fictitious job board developed as a mobile app that aggregates job listings from thousands of websites, enabling job seekers to apply to jobs by redirecting them to the employers' job application pages. Built with Expo SDK, a superset of React Native, JobIt consumes an API from Rapid API. This project serves as a proof of concept to teach myself the core concepts of mobile development using React Native. It is not fully developed, with some UI elements not responding to user input, or responding but not as intended, since the implementation is reduced to the absolute core functionality.
